## About

This repository contains a lightweight Python project that can create short videos from news or input text and images. It includes utilities for assembling images, adding text overlays, and exporting short video clips. Use it as a starting point for automating short video production or for learning how to combine simple image/video processing with templated outputs.

---

## Features ✅

- Compose images and text into short videos
- Template-driven generation
- Simple CLI/script usage
- Example images included in `images/`

---

## Project structure 🔎

- `app.py` — main app entry (run or import)  
- `video_generator.py` — video creation logic  
- `templates/` — HTML templates (if a web UI exists)  
- `images/` — source images used in example runs  
- `generated_videos/` — output videos (ignored in `.gitignore`)  
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies  

---

## Installation

1. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

- Run the main script:

```bash
python app.py
```

- Or call the generator directly from Python:

```python
from video_generator import generate_video
# pass an image list, captions, output path, etc.
```

See the code comments in `video_generator.py` for parameter details and examples.

## Generate an SVG for this project (AI prompt) 🎨

Use the prompt below with an AI that can generate SVG vector code (for example: an SVG-capable image model or text-to-SVG agent). The prompt is intentionally explicit so the model returns only SVG markup you can copy into a `.svg` file.

**Main prompt (copy & paste):**

"You are an SVG generator. Produce only valid, standalone SVG markup (no markdown, no explanation) that visually represents the "AI Video Generator" project. The design should be simple, flat, and modern with clear iconography: include a film strip or frames, a play button, and a stylized AI/brain or neural motif to indicate intelligence. Use a 16:9-friendly rectangular canvas (suggested viewBox '0 0 1200 675'). Use a compact color palette (primary: #2D9CDB - bright blue, accent: #F2994A - orange, neutral: #2D2D2D - dark gray, and white). Include the project name "AI Video Generator" as legible vector text integrated into the composition. Use scalable shapes (paths, circles, rects) and avoid external images or fonts—use basic system font fallback (e.g., sans-serif). Ensure the SVG is responsive (viewBox set) and keep file size reasonable with simplified paths. Provide one centered composition and one small icon variation in the same SVG (two groups, labeled with IDs) so I can extract either."

**Short prompt variant:**

"Create a single-file SVG icon for 'AI Video Generator' that shows a film strip, play symbol and an abstract neural/brain motif; return only the SVG code with viewBox '0 0 1200 675'."

**Tips for use:**

- Ask the AI to "Return ONLY SVG markup, no commentary" to make it easy to save as `.svg`.
- If you want multiple color/theme variants, request `variant: dark`, `variant: light` or `monochrome` in your prompt.

## Architecture / Workflow 🏗️

This repository includes a visual workflow diagram that explains how the `AI Video Generator` processes inputs through its components (Input → Assets → Processing → AI model → Output/Storage). The PNG diagram is included in the `images/` folder as `workflow.png`.

If you want, I can also generate a sample SVG right now using the prompt above and add it to `assets/logo.svg` — say the word and I’ll add it. ✨
