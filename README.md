## About

This repository contains a lightweight Python project that can create short videos from news or input text and images. It includes utilities for assembling images, adding text overlays, and exporting short video clips. Use it as a starting point for automating short video production or for learning how to combine simple image/video processing with templated outputs.

## Features ✅

- Compose images and text into short videos
- Template-driven generation
- Simple CLI/script usage
- Example images included in `images/`

---

## Project structure 🔎

- `app.py` — main app entry (run or import)  
- `video_generator.py` — video creation logic  
- `templates/` — HTML templates (if a web UI exists)  
- `images/` — source images used in example runs  
- `generated_videos/` — output videos (ignored in `.gitignore`)  
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies  

---

## Installation

1. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

- Run the main script:

```bash
python app.py
```

- Or call the generator directly from Python:

```python
from video_generator import generate_video
# pass an image list, captions, output path, etc.
```
